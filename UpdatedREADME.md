📌 Project Overview

Hospitals face continuous challenges in managing critical resources such as ICU beds, general beds, ventilators, and medical staff, especially during emergencies, seasonal outbreaks, or sudden patient surges. Traditional planning methods based on historical averages fail to capture the dynamic and nonlinear nature of healthcare demand.
This project presents a Time-Series Analytics Framework that leverages deep learning (LSTM) models to forecast hospital resource utilization and support proactive, data-driven decision-making. The system integrates predictive modeling with an interactive Streamlit dashboard, enabling real-time visualization, scenario simulation, and early warning alerts for potential shortages.
The framework is modular, scalable, and adaptable, making it suitable for deployment across different hospitals and healthcare environments.
